### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My passion for Information Technology was discovered during my high school career. In grade 9, I took extra-curricular classes where I was exposed to Java development and building static HTML websites.

The first website I developed happened a year later when I worked on a personal project for a family member who started breeding chihuahuas. That same year, it won the K9 website of the year award and this gave me the confidence and assurance that I was entering into the right field.

I then registered with a hosting company and through word of mouth, my network grew to 12 clients by the final year of secondary school.

In 2011, one of these clients approached me with a job opportunity that involved working on a three-month project at iOCO (formerly Airborne). This is where my journey with the company started.

Since then, I have worked on projects for clients in NGO, finance, and insurance industries among others. I am now a Lead Developer. Although I see myself as a full-stack developer, my passion is building amazing front-ends and front-end architecture.

Considering that my hobby has become my job, I spend most of my time coding and exploring new technologies. I am also a sucker for adventure activities and the great outdoors and enjoy this most in the company of family.
